long think
( 15.a4 I wanted to play this but worried about knight dropping into b4 15...b4 16.cxb4 Nc6 17.b5 this is why I'm not good at chess; I didn't even see b5 in my mind. I thought the b4 pawn was lost 17...Nb4 )
15...a5 16.bxc4 
( 16.a3 didn't look at this line. c3 pawn is safe from attack because queen gets trapped )
16...dxc4? 17.Ne5? Nd5 
I missed this move to attack weak c3 pawn
18.Nb1 
( 18.Ne4! as usual when I get flustered and upset, I make poor moves. I did not even consider this move! Ouch )
18...Rc8 19.Be4 b4 
Black is playing fast; 1:13m left

23...Bxd5 24.Nd2 Kg7 25.Ne4?? Bxe4?? 
( 25...b3! 26.axb3 cxb3 27.Qb2 )
26.Qxe4 Rab8 27.Qc2 Qc6 28.Rcb1 b3?? 29.axb3 cxb3 30.Rxb3 
25min
30...Rxb3 31.Qxb3 Qxc3 32.Qxc3 Rxc3 33.Rxa5 Rc4 34.Ra1? 
( 34.d5! White advantage. No clue why I didn't play this. I never considered it. )
