1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 Be6 
    {I expected Harry to play the Panov. I watched videos and went through
    Master games to prepare 6...Be6. Looks odd but is the top move in the 
    position. He seemed surprised.}
7.c5 g6 8.Nf3 Ne4!? 
    {thought about Bg7 but was too tempted to take the initiative. Bg7 is 
    the only Master move}
9.Bb5 Bg7 10.O-O O-O 
    {Long think about Nxc3 and Bg4}
11.Be3 Bg4 
    {60min}
12.Be2 
    {felt that Black position is solid after Be2 retreat}
12...b6 
    {Questionable move for two reasons in retrospect: Knight is undefended
    and a6 is weakened.}
13.Qa4 Nxc3 
    {50 min; also considered Rc8}
14.bxc3 Rc8 15.Ba6 Qc7? 
    {I thought about 15...Rc7 16. Bf4 e5 but couldn't make it work so I 
    settled for the exchange. Problem of miscalculation. 38 min}
    ( 15...Rc7! {This line looks so simple now but could not calculate it 
    over the board} 16.Bf4 e5 17.Nxe5 Nxe5 18.Bxe5 Bxe5 19.dxe5 )
16.Bxc8 Rxc8 17.cxb6 axb6 18.Qb3 Na5 
    {Played too quickly. Still reeling from losing the exchange}

    after the text move.} 49.Rxe3? fxe3 50.Rd1 e2 51.Re1 Kxd4 {=} )
