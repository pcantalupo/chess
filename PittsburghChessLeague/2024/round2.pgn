1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Bf5 3. Bf4 e6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Bd3 Bg6 6. O-O Bd6 7. Ne5
{ I already feel the position is cramped. I play poorly against Ne5
especially when I know Nd2 and Ndf3 is coming.}
Bxd3 8. cxd3
{ More cramping and limiting my f6 knight.}
O-O 9. Nd2 Nbd7 10. Ndf3 Qe7 11. Rc1 Rac8 12. Qa4 a6 13. Rc2 Nb6 14. Qb3 
{ started worrying about my undefended b-pawn with white Queen pressure and
that I cannot play c6 since my knight hangs. I never thought of playing Nh5
 to neutralize the bishop.}
Nfd7 15. Rfc1 
{ Confused what to play. Played hope chess with 15...Nxe5 that White would
capture back with the Knight so I could play Bxe5.}
Nxe5 16. dxe5 Bb4 17. a3 Ba5 18. Rc5 Bd2 (... Nc4!)
{ Black thought bishop was lost but engine shows that 18. Rc5 is a blunder. 18 Nc4!
This cuts off the defense of the c5 rook. }
19. Nxd2 
{ Black trying to close up the position but eventually White infiltrated with Queen.
Tried to trap white Queen but blundered multiple times.}
