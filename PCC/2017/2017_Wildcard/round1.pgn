8. Nc3?! {h3 was better for bishop flight square}
  (8. cxd5 {Gabriel said to think about this move since Black played Nbd7
            and would rather have knight on c6.}
  Nxd5 9. Bg3 N7f6 10. Nc3)
dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nh5 10. Bg3
  (10. Bg5 {If my king side pawns are going to get doubled, then at least force a weakness in his king side.}
  h6 11. Bh4 g5 12. Bg3 Nxg3 13. hxg3)
Nxg3
11. hxg3 Nb6 12. Be2 {better than b3, d3 since I don't have an h-pawn to kick Black bishop from Bg4} Bg4
13. Rc1
  (13. Nd2 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 e5 15. Nf3 exd4 16. Nxd4 Bxd4 17. Rfd1! {don't need to capture bishop with pawn since Qxd4}

23. Bxd5?! {Felt like I had to remove that strong knight but I lost 0.5 pts. Gabriel said knight is not strong b/c White can take it anytime and where is it going to go? He said to leave tension there b/c I invited his rook forward after capture.}
