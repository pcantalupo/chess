9. c4 c6 10. Rc1 Re8 {long think. Wanting to playing Nf8-Ng6 attacking bishop. Thought about a5 and a6. a5 would block b4 incase White wants to support a c5 push. 95min}
11. Re1
  (11. c5 { I worried about this push since I don't have Rb8 nor Qc7 in response to Qb3.} a5 12. Qb3 b6 {b5 and Qc8 are playable})
Ne4 {90min}
12. Bd3
  (12. Nxe4 {this was my idea behind Ne4. I wanted to give up my bishop pair for more control of e5 and I could play Bd6 but I didn't see c5 at the end of the line} Bxe4 13. Nd2 Nf6 14. Nxe4 Nxe4 15. c5!)
