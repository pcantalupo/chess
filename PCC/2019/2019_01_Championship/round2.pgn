9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Bd3 Nf6 11. Re1 Bd7 12. c3 Rc8 13. Bc4 {first long think}
  (13. e4 { did not really consider this. Was thinking about Qd2, Qb3, and Rc1. Had difficulty thinking about my plan of attack. How to efficiently decide on a plan??})

23. Bc2 {good move by the engine. I wanted to play d5.}
  (23. d5 {I saw this line but did feel I was developed enough to completely open the position. Black has a Queen battery and a clear path for Dark bishop} exd5 24. cxd5 cxd5 25. Bxd5 Nxd5 26. Rxd5 Qc6)
b6 24. Be5 {39 min. I spent on average 5 min for past 4 moves. Need to calculate quicker to save time for endgame}
b5 25. Bxf6 Bxf6 26. Bxe4 a6
27. d5? { I always seem to make the wrong choice when to advance pawns in the center during the middle game.}
cxd5 28. cxd5 e5 29. Bf3 {I thought about d6 but did not want pawn on dark square where I lose a defender and Black has dark bishop}
