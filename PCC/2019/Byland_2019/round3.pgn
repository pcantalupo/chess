1.d4 {I tried to play a patient game without trying to calculate complex 
lines} 1...Nf6 2.Bf4 c6 3.c3 g6 4.e3 d5 5.Bd3 Bg7 6.Nf3 O-O 7.h3 Nh5 8.Bh2

sure what to do. 97min} 13...e6 14.a4 a5 15.Qc2 {Retreated since I thought
f3 knight was going to get pushed away from King side attack and wanted to
try to dislodge e4 knight} 15...Bh6 16.Nd2 ( 16.g4 $5 {Wanted to fork f6 
and h6. Decided against to play a quieter, patient game} ) 16...Nxd2 17.

this line to kick knight away but again, I played more patient, and slower
} 19...Ra7 20.f3 ) 19...Qf6 20.Be5 Qf7 21.Bxe4 {Saw line to take control 
of the dark squares by getting Knight to e5 or f6. Thought my knight would
be better than his light bishop} 21...fxe4 22.Nh2 Bg7 23.f4 ( 23.Ng4 {more
principled and in the spirit of playing pateintly and slowly} ) 23...b5

thought it was dead} 25.Bxg7 Qxg7 26.Rf2 bxa4 27.Qd2 Bb5 28.Ne5 Ra7 29.Qc2
