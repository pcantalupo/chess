1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 Nd7 6.Nbd2 c5 {Only 2 Master games
played this move. Ne7 is top move (26 games)
} 7.O-O cxd4 8.Nxd4 Ne7 {I was playing quickly. 1hr 18min} 9.f4 Qb6 $2 {
Why not put the knight in a pin? However, engine disagrees and i'm not 
sure why} ( 9...Bg6 {Thought about this move; didn't like the pawn storm. 
Here is a way to deal with it!

Saw that this line was not good.} 17.f5 exf5 18.Rxf5 ) ( 16...Qd8 ) 17.Be3
Qc7 18.Rac1 Nd8 {I had a long plan to reposition knight on e4 via b7 and 
c5 but in retrospect it is too slow. I want to trade my Bishop for his 
Knight since I think my Knight will be much stronger than his dark Bishop.
} ( 18...Na5 {saw this line but went with the text plan
} 19.Nd4 Qd7 20.b3 Nc6 $10 ) ( 18...b5 {Thought this might be a way to 
induce Nc5 so I could trade off Knight} 19.Nc5 Bxc5 20.Bxc5 Rfe8 21.Bd6

Qd3 Rc8 26.Rfc1 Rfc7 27.c4 dxc4 {Long think 51 min left. Saw idea to win 
b2 pawn with threat to win rook} 28.Rxc4 Qxb2 {45min} 29.h3 Rxc4 {I missed
how the trade of rooks at the end was a draw. If I'd have seen that, then 
maybe I would have thought seriously about trading my queen for his two 
rooks. Still, I was worried that his Queen would get to active on my weak 
e6 pawn.
