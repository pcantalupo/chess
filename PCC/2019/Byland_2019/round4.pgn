1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 {I prepared a new line against Mark 
since we played the main line before.} 5.Bc4 Ngf6 6.Ng3 Nb6 7.Bb3 e6 8.Nf3
c5 {Prepared this move. Top move by Masters. 1hr 14min} 9.c3 cxd4 10.cxd4 
Bb4+ 11.Bd2 {Felt like I was equalized and happy with position} 11...Be7 
$5 {During game I regretted not capturing. Felt like his bishop was going 
to get active while Be7 would be too passive. I was right; see move 24. 
Ba5} 12.O-O O-O {1hr 5min} 13.Ba5 Qd6 ( 13...Bd7 {Saw this line but 
worried about the pin. That is why I played the text move} 14.Ne5 Rc8 ) 
14.Re1 Nbd5 15.Rc1 b6 16.Bd2 Bb7 17.a3 Rac8 {99min} 18.Qe2 a6 {88min. Was 
not sure what to do here} 19.Ne5 Rxc1 20.Rxc1 b5 {77min} 21.Bc2 Nb6 ( 
21...b4 {Mark suggested this move since I have alot of control of b4 and 
he said he was having trouble deciding on good moves. In retrospect, if he
pushes a4 then that should be good for Black with more space. If captures,
then d5 square is vacated for Queen or Bishop.} 22.a4 ) 22.Qd3 Qd5 23.f3 
Rd8 {played too fast; too eager to pressure the d-file; totally missed the
Ba5 pin; didn't think about my undefended pieces!} 24.Ba5 Rd6 ( 24...Bc5 
$1 25.dxc5 {Saw these two moves but thought would have to capture White 
Queen. I completely missed the capture and check with Qxc5. Miscalculation
error} 25...Qxc5+ $1 ) 25.Bb4 Qxd4+ $4 {54min long think} 26.Qxd4 Rxd4 27.
