1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Nf3 d6 5.Nbd2 {Need to play h3 here. Top move
by masters} 5...O-O 6.c3 Nbd7 7.Be2 {Bc4 is top master move. I did not 
want to play Bd3 since worried about e5-e4 push.} 7...Re8 8.Qc2 c6 9.h3 {
e4 or Bg3 are good also} 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Bg3 e4 12.Nd4 Nc5 13.O-O {
1h10min} 13...Be6 14.N2b3 {1hr5min; Nc4} 14...Qb6 15.Nxc5 Qxc5 16.Nb3 Qb6 
17.Rad1 {after I moved, I realized I abandoned defense of a2 pawn and felt
the pressure of his Queen/Bishop bearing down on my queen side knight and 
pawn structure.} 17...Rad8 18.Bd6 {long thought 80min left. Engine suggest
Nd2-Nc4. I did not see this line} 18...Bxb3 19.Qxb3 Qxb3 20.axb3 Nd5 21.
Bc5 {Ba3, Bg3 73min} 21...b6 22.Bd4 c5 23.Bxg7 Kxg7 24.Bb5 Rf8 25.Rd2 {
played quickly} 25...Nc7 26.Rxd8 {played quickly. I was frustrated that I 
did not see his discovered attack on two of my undefended pieces. I 
thought this was my only move. After this, I got down on myself and 
started to play quickly.} ( 26.Bd7 $1 {followed by doubling of rooks} ) 
26...Rxd8 27.Bc6 {fast move} 27...f5 28.c4 Rd2 29.Rb1 Rd3 30.Ba4 a6 31.b4

two moves} 38.Rd1 Rxd1+ 39.Kxd1 b3 40.Kd2 a5 41.Kc3 a4 42.f3 h5 43.g4 Nd3

45...hxg4 46.hxg4 fxg4 47.fxg4 Kf6 $1 {Black has chances. Totally missed 
this line} ) 46.gxh5 gxh5 47.f4 h4 48.Kc3 Ke6 49.Kb4 Kd6 50.Kxa4 Kc5 51.
