Bc2 b4 10.e4 bxc3 11.bxc3 Be7 12.Rb1 Bc6 13.Ne5 {long think 102min left; 
thought about exd5 but didn't like it} 13...O-O ( 13...Qa5 {I saw that 
this was a good move but did not spend anytime on possible lines} ) 14.
Rxb8 {played in about 30 seconds which was too fast since I didn't 
consider if I could really save my knight after Nxe7+; tactic of removing 
the defender; top move by engine} 14...Qxb8 15.Nxc6 Qxf4 16.Nxe7+ Kh8 17.
Nc6 Nxe4 18.g3 {5 min think; also considered Nxe4} 18...Qh6 19.Bxe4 {5min 
think; 90 min left; felt like I needed to trade my bishop so that I would 
have the two knights; also thought about Ne5 which would have been a 
blunder that I completely missed over the board -> Nxc3! attacking my 
queen} 19...dxe4 20.Ne5 f5 21.O-O {80 min left} 21...f4 22.Qxe4 Rab8 23.
Ndf3 fxg3 24.fxg3 g5 ( 24...Rb2 {I was hoping for this so I could win his 
Queen or give checkmate} 25.Nf7+ Kg8 26.Nxh6+ ) 25.Nf7+ Rxf7 26.Qe5+ Qf6
