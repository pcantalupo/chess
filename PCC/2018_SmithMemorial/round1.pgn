1. d4 c5 {blocks White from playing the London!} 2. d5 e6 3. c4 Nf6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6
6. Bf4!? {Premature. e2-e4 is going to be played so no rush to get Bishop out. e4 or Nf3 are top two lines}
  (6. e4 g6 7. f4! Bg7)
g6 7. Nf3 Bg7 8. e4 a6 9. a4 O-O 10. Bd3 {I had difficult deciding between Bd3 and Be2}
Re8 11. O-O c4 {a novelty in Master games} 12. Bc2
  (12. Bxc4 {I didn't play this because I was going to be a pawn down with playing 13. Qc2 } Nxe4 13. Qc2
    (13. Nxe4 Bxb2 {I quickly dismissed ever taking on e4 with my Knight because of Bxb2 but did not realize I had Nxd6 with a threat on rook and b7} 14. Nxd6!)
  Nxc3 14. bxc3 Qc7 15. Bd3 Qxc3 16. Qxc3 Bxc3)
Bg4 13. h3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qe7 15. Qe2 Qc7 16. Qd2 Nbd7 17. Rfe1 Rab8 18. a5 Nh5 19. Be3 Nc5
20. f3
  (20. Ra3 { I thought about this but was feeling pressure on e4 which in retrospect was a ghost. Also Ra3 disconnects my rooks and I've been having problems with coordinating my pieces in many games})
Rbc8 21. g4 {I played this to then play Bd4. If I reversed move order, Black Knights were going to dominate d3 square}
  (21. Bd4 Bxd4+ 22. Qxd4 Nf4 {d3 square is dominated by Black knights})
Nf6 22. Bd4 Qd8 23. Na4 {long think; 39min left} Nfd7 24. Bxg7 Kxg7 25. Nxc5 { long think; 26min left}
Rxc5 26. Ba4 {trying to get rid of the Knight since it was going to dominate my dark squares}
Rxa5 27. Qc3+ Kg8 28. Bxd7 Rxa1 29. Rxa1 Qxd7 30. Qxc4 Rc8 31. Qd4? {my downfall starts; I'm having difficulty finding good moves in an open heavy piece ending} Qb5
32. Rd1? Qe2 33. Qd2 {played this immediately since I was upset for having let the Queen infiltrate}
Qxf3 34. Qd3 Qf4 35. Rd2 Rc1+ 36. Kg2 Re1 37. Rf2 Qxe4+ 38. Qxe4 Rxe4 39. Rf6 Re2+ 40. Kg3 Rxb2 41. Rxd6 Kf8
